# Summary

This is an exercice to learn the Rust language.

Let's first build a basic Lisp interpreter in Typescript, then re-implement it in Rust.

This will allow me to learn non trivial concepts of the Rust language, especially for properly managing memory.

At the same time, building an interpreter is also a good exercice to sharpen my programming skills.

Finally, I plan to try generating a Web assembly from Rust and try the interpreter in a browser.
